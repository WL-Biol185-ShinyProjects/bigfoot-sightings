## Why Bigfoot?
As science majors, our group wanted to step outside our usual realm and explore 
a topic that blurs the line between myth and reality; Bigfoot. 
Being able to research without having to read an exhausting scientific paper 
gave us much joy, and we hope you got a similar amount of joy going through our website!

If you've ever wondered where Bigfoot has been found or where you should look next 
in your search, then our app is the right place for you. 

## What we offer
We provide interactive maps showing sighting locations, weather data analysis for reported
encounters, multiple filtering tools to explore patterns and trends, detailed 
information about each sighting report, and a probability predictor of seeing Bigfoot based
on user input. Other highlights include a visual representation of sighting descriptions
in the form of a word cloud; correlations with bear observations, forest coverage/land area,
and census land area; simple visualizations of sightings per state, temperature, and season
with a clickable interface, and an awesome moon phase tracker, detailing the number of sightings
per moon phase, and the correlation between moon brightness and number of sightings.
